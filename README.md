# System-Call-Trace-Analysis-ADFA-LD-Dataset
This set of .py files is an implementation of different feature extraction techniques, dimensionality reduction, and classification model testing for system call traces in the ADFA-LD dataset.

# Description of the Files:
main_bool.py: Uses the .txt files from the ADFA-LD dataset to perform system call trace feature extraction using the Boolean Model for n-gram terms. The resulting dataset is saved as a .csv file.

main_freq.py: Uses the .txt files from the ADFA-LD dataset to perform system call trace feature extraction using frequency counts for n-gram terms. The resulting dataset is saved as a .csv file.

main_tfidf.py: Uses the .txt files from the ADFA-LD dataset to perform system call trace feature extraction using TF-IDF values for n-gram terms. The resulting dataset is saved as a .csv file.

Latest Model Testing.py: Performs dimensionality reduction using Truncated SVD given a .csv data file generated by one of the above .py files. Following dimensionality reduction, this file constructs and tests classification models using Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logisitic Regression, and Random Forest Classification. Calculated performance metrics include: accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and false positive rate. Optional ROC curves may be generated as well.
